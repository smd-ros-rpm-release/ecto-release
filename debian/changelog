ros-hydro-ecto (0.6.8-0quantal) quantal; urgency=high

  * threadable plasms update.
    This reintroduces some level of threading into ecto. It was initially
    removed in c2a24a51, but this left some legacy code
    wasn't working as expressed in the documentation. These updates
    allow parallel execution of plasms in separate threads. It doesn't
    quite reach the scope of the original plan for ecto (threading for
    free *inside* a plasms computation), but it does cover several useful
    scenarios.
  * convenience class for scheduling plasms across threads.
  * Reformatted cell processing result handler (trivial).
    For clarity, and points back to an issue created which discusses
    the BREAK/CONTINUE options.
  * Don't clobber the underlying c++ executions when aborting, be graceful.
    Previously used PyErr_SetInterrupt which would send a keyboard interrupt
    back to the controlling python script. However we don't want to abort
    in this way - it is preferable to let the execution gracefully bow out.
    More information and the actual code that does the bowing out is in
    pull request #250 <https://github.com/plasmodic/ecto/issues/250>.
  * activate gil release/call macros
  * Be free of the GIL!
    This lets ecto pipeline processing be free of its evil overlord, the [GIL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock). That is, you can now schedule different plasms in different threads...e.g. some pseudocode:
    # ...construct some plasms
    image_scheduler = ecto.Scheduler(image_plasm)
    odometry_scheduler = ecto.Scheduler(odometry_plasm)
    image_thread = threading.Thread(name="image_thread", target=image_scheduler.execute)
    odometry_thread = threading.Thread(name="odometry_thread", target=odometry_scheduler.execute)
    image_thread.start()
    odometry_thread.start()
    image_thread.join()
    odometry_thread.join()
    ```
    Of course, inside a cell's process() call, you can always grab the GIL momentarily if you need to using the opposite macro...`ECTO_SCOPED_CALLPYTHON`.
  * Bugfix python lookup for internal class variables
    Probably went unnoticed for a long time since it wasn't used. Came across this (I think - was quite a while ago) while fleshing out pythonic cell construction with names and parameter args. Should have gone in at the same time as 39b9cad9.
  * fix doc
    fixes #239 <https://github.com/plasmodic/ecto/issues/239>
